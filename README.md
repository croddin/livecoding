livecoding
==========

Some work on a livecoding environment like the one in Bret Victor's talk &quot;Inventing on Principle&quot; at http://vimeo.com/36579366

The tree example from the talk seems to work best in Safari. (Firefox and Chrome couldn't re-render in realtime)

To run on localhost run

	python -m SimpleHTTPServer
	
from this directory then go to http://localhost:8000



tree.js and game.js were copied from the talk and &copy; 2012 Bret Victor
